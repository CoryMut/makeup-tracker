# makeup-tracker

The purpose of this project was to create a place to keep track of your makeup! 
Makeup is a large industry and some people can end up with some pretty large collections, but there was not a convenient place to sort or track it all.

The data (encompassing over 17,000 products) is largely from Ulta, with the hope of adding Sephora in the future.

The name, brand, color, type, category, and price are all collected for each product.
